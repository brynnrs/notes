# History of the Web

**Tim Berners-Lee** working at CERN
Linked Notebook Idea
Information Management: A Proposal
Service Side Rendering in first proposal
Hack to get people to use it
take information people needed and put it in his system
First Web Server was a Static file server
Web Browser (works on NEXT Computer)
You can edit any webpage you visit
Check Spelling and Format (Early Dev Tools)
**Nicola Pellow** invented a way to render hypertext to plain text format on computers others had

**Pei Wei** ViollaWWW (Uni of Cali at Berkley) 
- invented scripting language (dynamically change content)
- put Stylesheet language in browser

NCSA Mosaic was first cross-platform browser used by lots of people
windows 3.1 needed third-party Trumpet Winsock to start up browser correctly
introduced Inline images (previously only opened in external windows)

1993- Mark Andreessen proposed new tag `<img>` and Tim Berners-Lee opposed and suggested `<a>` instead
Debate ensued and ended with no clear outcome for the tag name
1994- Tim Berners-Lee founded W3C to guide browsers on what standards to follow
1994-95 Marc Andreessen - Start-up for gaming network (for n64):  
Nintendo took too long, they decided to make a browser instead (Netscape Navigator 1.0)
It was sold to IPO a year later which started the .com bubble
1995- Microsoft licensed NCSA Mosaic sourcecode, wrapped it in some "Windows-y stuff", and released it as Internet Explorer 1.0
Started first browser wars between Netscape and IE (won by a landslide but caused legal troubles)

Rasmus Lerdorf - Personal Homepage (PHP) Tools, 1.0 (dedicated language for generating web pages)
(Admitted he didn't know what he was doing and didn't mean to create a language)
One of the most successful web technologies that has ever been created

**Front End **
born 1996 with creation of Javascript, CSS, Macromedia FLASH, and Microsoft FrontPage
Microsoft FrontPage held users hand through webpage creating process with a wizard, step-by-step basic instructions, and a webpage link tree overview. It also allowed you to write script (JavaScript or VBScript) and run on your server.
Dangerously powerful ASP phase of development = people could write VB and it would just run

Brendan Eich created Javascript ("in 10 days")
- worked under Mark Andreessen at Netscape while Netscape 2.0 was being developed.
- commissioned by Mark to create a programming language that could run inside a webpage for a demo

CSS was community effort from beginning
- winning design was by Hakon Wium Lie which set much of the base design and terminology

Accessibility 
Legal requirement for webdevs since web was created due to existing legislation
Berners-Lee wrote to W3C newsletter asking about accessibility implementation
